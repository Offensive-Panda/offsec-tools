# OffSec Tools
This repository is intended for pentesters and red teamers using a variety of offensive security tools during their assessments. The repository is a collection of useful tools suitable for assessments in internal environments. We regularly fetch and compile the latest version of each tool and make it available to you as a release.

You don't have to worry about updating and compiling the tools yourself. Just download the latest version and find all the tools you need in a single archive.

Happy Hacking!  
Team Syslifters
