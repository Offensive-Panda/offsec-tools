# OffSec Tools
This repository is meant for pentesters, red teamers and everyone else using a variety of offensive security tools during engagements. The repo is a collection of useful tools suitable for audits in internal environments. We regularily fetch and compile the newest version of each tool and provide them to you as release.

You do not have to hassle with updating and compiling the tools yourself. Just download the latest release and find all tools that you will need in one single archive.

Happy Hacking!  
Team Syslifters
